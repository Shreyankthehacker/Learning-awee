# 🧠 AI-Powered Educational Assistant with Dynamic Math Animations 🎓📹

Welcome to a next-generation learning assistant that **brings concepts to life** with the power of **AI, animations, and smart recommendations**!  
This project builds a **modular, intelligent graph** that takes a learner’s query and responds with rich, personalized educational content.

---

## 🚀 What This Project Does

When you ask a question like _“What is a derivative?”_ or _“Explain eigenvectors”_, the system doesn’t just give a text answer — it builds a **whole learning experience** around it, including:

### 🎥 Math Concept Animations (using Manim)

Visualize abstract math ideas like never before!

- Powered by **Manim**, animations are dynamically generated by an **LLM** to show you how a concept works, step-by-step.
- Think: **tangent lines sliding across curves**, **eigenvectors transforming space**, **chain rule unraveling layers** — all animated with precision.
- ✨ _No static diagrams, just beautiful, code-generated motion._

---

### 🧠 LLM-Written & Debugged Code

Every Manim animation is:

- ✍️ **Written by a Large Language Model (LLM)**
- 🔧 **Debugged and refined by the LLM** before rendering

The system builds **Python scripts live**, tailored to your query, and creates educational videos on the fly.  
_No human intervention required!_

---

## 📚 What's Included in Each Response?

💬 Based on your query, the system returns a **multi-dimensional answer** including:

- 📹 **Manim Animation Video** of the concept  
- 🎓 **Course recommendations** from trusted platforms like **NPTEL**  
- 📘 **Books** that explain the topic in depth  
- 🧪 **Solved examples** for better practice  
- ❓ **Similar or related questions** to extend your understanding  
- 📰 **Blog-style explanations** from sources like **Wikipedia**  
- 🎥 **YouTube video suggestions**, fetched live via API  

---

## 🕸️ How It Works (Conceptually)

1. A query is entered.
2. The **LLM parses the query**, determining which educational tools to activate.
3. Each tool (node) in a **LangGraph** handles a different aspect: animation, explanation, recommendations, etc.
4. The result is a **rich, personalized learning bundle**, created just for you in real-time.
